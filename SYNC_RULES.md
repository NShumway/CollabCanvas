# CollabCanvas Sync Architecture Rules

**CRITICAL: Read this document before working with any sync-related code.**

This document defines the bulletproof sync architecture that prevents infinite loops, echo effects, race conditions, and ghost objects that plagued our first implementation attempt.

## Core Architecture Principles

### 1. Strict Write/Read Path Separation

**NEVER mix write and read operations in the same function or component.**

#### Write Path (syncEngine.js)
- **Purpose:** Handle all writes TO Firestore
- **Files:** `src/services/syncEngine.js`
- **Operations:** `applyLocalChange()`, `queueWrite()`, `flushWrites()`
- **Rule:** NEVER add listeners or read operations to this file

#### Read Path (useFirestoreSync.js)
- **Purpose:** Handle all reads FROM Firestore  
- **Files:** `src/hooks/useFirestoreSync.js`
- **Operations:** `onSnapshot` listener, echo prevention, conflict resolution
- **Rule:** NEVER add write operations to this file

### 2. Echo Prevention (Critical)

Every Firestore listener update must pass through TWO echo prevention checks:

#### Check #1: hasPendingWrites Metadata
```javascript
if (change.doc.metadata.hasPendingWrites) {
  console.log('üîÑ Skipping echo (hasPendingWrites):', id);
  return;
}
```

#### Check #2: Local Pending Writes Map
```javascript
if (hasPendingWrite(id)) {
  console.log('üîÑ Skipping echo (in pendingWrites):', id);
  return;
}
```

**Why Two Checks?** Firestore metadata isn't always reliable during network issues. Our local pending writes map provides backup protection.

### 3. Timestamp-Based Conflict Resolution

Always use server timestamps as the authority:

```javascript
// Only update if remote timestamp is newer than local
if (existingShape && remoteTimestamp <= localTimestamp) {
  console.log('‚è∞ Skipping stale remote update');
  return;
}
```

### 4. Three-Tier State Architecture

Our Zustand store has three tiers of state:

#### Tier 1: Rendering State (What Users See)
- `shapes: {}` - All shapes on canvas
- `selectedIds: []` - Currently selected shapes  
- `viewport: { x, y, zoom }` - Canvas viewport
- `users: {}` - Other users (cursors, presence)

#### Tier 2: Sync Tracking (Prevents Echo Loops)
- `pendingWrites: {}` - Tracks shapes with uncommitted writes
- `currentUser: null` - Authenticated user info

#### Tier 3: Connection State (Network Monitoring)
- `connectionState: 'connected'` - Connection status
- `lastSyncTimestamp: 0` - Last successful sync

## Sync Flow (Step by Step)

### Creating a Shape
1. User clicks canvas ‚Üí `handleStageClick()` in Canvas.jsx
2. **Write Path:** `syncEngine.applyLocalChange()` ‚Üí Updates Zustand immediately
3. **Write Path:** `syncEngine.queueWrite()` ‚Üí Marks pending, queues Firestore write
4. **Write Path:** `syncEngine.flushWrites()` ‚Üí Batch commits to Firestore
5. **Read Path:** `useFirestoreSync` listener receives change
6. **Read Path:** Echo prevention checks pass/fail
7. **Read Path:** If legitimate remote change, update Zustand

### Dragging a Shape
1. User drags shape ‚Üí `handleDragMove()` in Shape.jsx
2. **Write Path:** `syncEngine.applyLocalChange()` ‚Üí Updates Zustand immediately (60fps)
3. **Write Path:** `syncEngine.queueWrite(debounced=true)` ‚Üí Batches rapid updates
4. On drag end ‚Üí `syncEngine.queueWrite(immediate=true)` ‚Üí Flushes immediately
5. **Read Path:** Same as above, but debounced writes reduce Firestore calls

## Critical Rules

### ‚ùå NEVER DO THESE (Will Break Sync)

1. **Don't update Zustand inside Firestore write callbacks**
   ```javascript
   // ‚ùå WRONG - Creates infinite loops
   await setDoc(shapeRef, data);
   updateShape(id, data); // NO!
   ```

2. **Don't mix write and read paths**
   ```javascript
   // ‚ùå WRONG - Same function does both
   const syncShape = async (shape) => {
     updateShape(shape.id, shape); // Local update
     await writeShape(shape);      // Firestore write
   }
   ```

3. **Don't skip echo prevention checks**
   ```javascript
   // ‚ùå WRONG - Always check for echoes
   changes.forEach(change => {
     updateShape(change.id, change.data); // NO!
   });
   ```

4. **Don't use client timestamps for conflict resolution**
   ```javascript
   // ‚ùå WRONG - Client clocks can be wrong
   if (remoteShape.clientTimestamp > localShape.clientTimestamp)
   
   // ‚úÖ CORRECT - Server timestamps are authoritative
   if (remoteShape.updatedAt > localShape.updatedAt)
   ```

### ‚úÖ ALWAYS DO THESE (Bulletproof Sync)

1. **Always check hasPendingWrites AND pendingWrites map**
2. **Always use server timestamps (serverTimestamp()) for Firestore writes**
3. **Always update local state immediately for 60fps UX**
4. **Always queue writes through SyncEngine, never direct Firestore calls**
5. **Always handle errors gracefully (network issues are common)**

## File Responsibilities

### src/services/syncEngine.js
- ‚úÖ Local state updates (`applyLocalChange`)
- ‚úÖ Write queuing and batching
- ‚úÖ Firestore batch writes
- ‚ùå NO listeners or read operations

### src/hooks/useFirestoreSync.js  
- ‚úÖ Firestore onSnapshot listener
- ‚úÖ Echo prevention logic
- ‚úÖ Timestamp-based conflict resolution
- ‚ùå NO write operations

### src/components/Canvas/Canvas.jsx
- ‚úÖ User interactions (click, drag)
- ‚úÖ Calls SyncEngine for writes
- ‚úÖ Uses useFirestoreSync for reads
- ‚ùå NO direct Firestore operations

### src/components/Canvas/Shape.jsx
- ‚úÖ Shape rendering and events
- ‚úÖ Calls SyncEngine for position updates
- ‚ùå NO direct Firestore operations

## Testing Protocol

After any sync changes, ALWAYS test with 2+ browsers:

1. **Create shapes simultaneously** - No duplicates should appear
2. **Drag same shape in both browsers** - Should sync smoothly  
3. **Check browser console** - No infinite loops or errors
4. **Refresh browsers** - State should persist correctly
5. **Test network interruption** - Should reconnect gracefully

## Common Bugs and Solutions

### Infinite Loops
- **Cause:** Firestore write triggers listener update triggers local update
- **Solution:** Check both echo prevention mechanisms
- **Detection:** CPU spikes, console spam, browser freezes

### Ghost Objects  
- **Cause:** Race condition between create and sync
- **Solution:** Use pending writes map correctly
- **Detection:** Duplicate shapes appearing/disappearing

### Stale Data
- **Cause:** Not checking timestamps properly
- **Solution:** Always compare server timestamps
- **Detection:** Old changes overwriting new changes

### Performance Issues
- **Cause:** Too many Firestore writes during drag
- **Solution:** Use debounced writes during continuous operations
- **Detection:** High Firestore usage, slow sync

## Architecture Evolution

This is our **second attempt** at sync architecture. The first attempt failed because:

1. ‚ùå Mixed write and read paths in same hooks
2. ‚ùå Insufficient echo prevention  
3. ‚ùå Race conditions between local and remote updates
4. ‚ùå No clear separation of concerns

The current architecture fixes all these issues through:

1. ‚úÖ Strict write/read path separation
2. ‚úÖ Bulletproof echo prevention (two-layer checks)
3. ‚úÖ Server timestamp authority for conflict resolution
4. ‚úÖ Clean separation of concerns across files

## When Working on Sync Code

1. **Read this document first** - Every time
2. **Reference the specific rules** - While coding
3. **Test with 2 browsers** - After every change
4. **Monitor console logs** - For echo prevention messages
5. **Watch CPU usage** - For infinite loop detection

**Remember: Sync architecture is the foundation of multiplayer functionality. Get it wrong and everything breaks. Get it right and everything just works.**
