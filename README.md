## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Sync Architecture (The Heart of Multiplayer)

CollabCanvas uses a **hybrid local-first approach** with strict separation of write and read paths:

```
User Action → Local Update (60fps) → Queue Write → Firestore → Other Users
                     ↑                                              ↓
                Real-time UX                            Firestore Listener → Echo Prevention → Remote Update
```

**Key Architecture Files:**
- `src/services/syncEngine.js` - **Write path only** (applyLocalChange, queueWrite, flushWrites)
- `src/hooks/useFirestoreSync.js` - **Read path only** (listeners, echo prevention, conflict resolution)
- `SYNC_RULES.md` - **Critical rules document** (read before editing sync code)

### State Management (Three-Tier Zustand Store)

```javascript
{
  // Tier 1: Rendering State (what users see)
  shapes: { [id]: { type, x, y, width, height, fill, updatedAt, ... } },
  selectedIds: [],
  viewport: { x, y, zoom },
  users: { [uid]: { name, cursorX, cursorY, color, online } },
  
  // Tier 2: Sync Tracking (prevents echo loops)
  pendingWrites: { [shapeId]: timestamp },
  currentUser: { uid, displayName, color },
  
  // Tier 3: Connection State (network monitoring)
  connectionState: 'connected' | 'disconnected' | 'reconnecting',
  lastSyncTimestamp: number
}
```

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React 18 + Vite + Tailwind CSS
- **Canvas:** React-Konva (high-performance Canvas API wrapper)
- **State:** Zustand (lightweight, perfect for canvas state)
- **Backend:** Firebase Firestore (real-time listeners) + Firebase Auth
- **AI:** Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4 (Post-MVP)
- **Deployment:** Firebase Hosting

## 🛠️ Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Firebase project access (or create your own)

### Quick Start

1. **Clone and install:**
   ```bash
   git clone [repo-url]
   cd CollabCanvas
   npm install
   ```

2. **Environment setup:**
   Create `.env.local` with your Firebase config:
   ```env
   VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
   VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
   VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
   VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.appspot.com
   VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
   VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
   VITE_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key
   ```

3. **Firebase setup:**
   - Enable Firestore Database (start in test mode)
   - Enable Authentication → Google provider
   - Add your domain to authorized domains

4. **Run development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Test multiplayer:**
   - Open multiple browser windows to `http://localhost:5173`
   - Sign in with different Google accounts
   - Test shape creation and dragging between windows

### Build and Deploy

```bash
npm run build
firebase deploy
# or deploy to Vercel/Netlify
```

## 🎯 Performance Targets (All Met)

- **Rendering:** 60 FPS during pan, zoom, and drag operations
- **Cursor Sync:** <50ms latency between users
- **Shape Sync:** <100ms latency for shape updates  
- **Concurrent Users:** Tested with 2+ users simultaneously
- **Shape Count:** 50+ shapes without performance degradation

## 🧪 Testing Guide

### Manual Testing Protocol

**Basic Functionality:**
1. Open 2 browser windows side-by-side
2. Sign in with different Google accounts
3. Verify both users appear in online users list
4. Move mouse in one window, verify cursor appears in other
5. Create rectangle in one window, verify it appears in other
6. Drag rectangle in one window, verify smooth sync in other

**Edge Cases Testing:**
1. **Rapid Creation:** Click create button 10 times rapidly - no duplicates should appear
2. **Simultaneous Editing:** Both users drag same shape - should sync smoothly
3. **Network Issues:** Disconnect one user's network, make changes, reconnect - changes should sync
4. **Refresh Testing:** Refresh browser, verify all shapes and state persist
5. **Performance:** Create 50+ shapes, verify 60 FPS maintained

**Sync Architecture Validation:**
1. Open browser console in both windows
2. Look for echo prevention messages: `🔄 Skipping echo (hasPendingWrites)`
3. Verify no infinite loops or excessive re-renders
4. Check Network tab for reasonable Firestore usage

## 🚨 Critical Architecture Rules

> **⚠️ BEFORE EDITING SYNC CODE: Read `SYNC_RULES.md`**

This project uses a bulletproof sync architecture that prevents infinite loops, ghost objects, and race conditions. The architecture has strict rules that **must not be violated**:

### Core Rules:
1. **Never mix write and read paths** - Keep SyncEngine (writes) separate from useFirestoreSync (reads)
2. **Always check for echoes** - Use both `hasPendingWrites` and `pendingWrites` map
3. **Server timestamps are authority** - Use `serverTimestamp()` for conflict resolution
4. **Test with 2+ browsers** - After every sync-related change

### Why SYNC_RULES.md Exists:
- This is our **second attempt** at sync architecture (first failed due to infinite loops)
- Contains step-by-step sync flow documentation
- Lists common bugs and their solutions
- Defines file responsibilities to prevent mixing concerns
- **Must be referenced** when working on multiplayer features

## 🔮 Post-MVP Roadmap

### Phase 2: Enhanced Canvas (Days 2-4)
- Additional shapes (circles, lines, text)
- Resize and rotation handles
- Multi-select and layer management
- Color picker and styling options
- Delete, duplicate, copy/paste operations

### Phase 3: AI Agent (Days 5-7)
- Natural language shape creation
- AI-powered layout assistance
- Complex operation planning
- Chat interface for commands

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

### MVP Scope Limitations:
- **Single shape type:** Only rectangles (by design for MVP)
- **No shape editing:** Can't resize, rotate, or change colors
- **No shape deletion:** Created shapes are permanent (Post-MVP feature)
- **Single canvas:** All users share one canvas (`default-canvas`)
- **No access control:** No distinction between canvas owners and collaborators
- **Basic error handling:** Network errors may require refresh

### UI/UX Issues:
- **Minimal interface:** Very basic toolbar and UI styling
- **Username scaling:** User labels zoom with canvas content instead of staying readable
- **Viewport persistence:** Pan and zoom position reset on browser refresh
- **Window resize handling:** Canvas doesn't adapt to new window dimensions properly
- **Update dependencies:** Some UI components (like active users list) only refresh during mouse movement

### Technical Limitations:
- **Presence detection delay:** Takes ~30 seconds to detect when users close their browser tab
- **Conflict resolution testing:** Multi-user conflict scenarios need more comprehensive testing
- **Firestore quotas:** Heavy usage may hit free tier limits
- **Security rules:** Currently in test mode (open access)
- **Mobile support:** Optimized for desktop browsers

### Performance Notes:
- **Shape limit:** Performance tested up to 50 shapes
- **User limit:** Tested with 2-5 concurrent users
- **Network dependency:** Requires stable internet for sync

## 🤝 Contributing

### Before Making Sync Changes:
1. **Read `SYNC_RULES.md`** - Contains critical architecture rules
2. **Test with multiple browsers** - Always verify multiplayer functionality  
3. **Monitor console logs** - Watch for echo prevention and errors
4. **Check performance** - Maintain 60 FPS during interactions

### Development Workflow:
1. Make changes in a feature branch
2. Test locally with 2+ browser windows
3. Verify no infinite loops or ghost objects
4. Deploy to staging environment
5. Test deployed version before merging
