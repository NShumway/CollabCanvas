## Technical Architecture

### Zustand Store

**Current MVP**
```js
{
  shapes: { [id]: { type, x, y, width, height, fill, updatedAt, ... } },
  selectedIds: [],
  viewport: { x, y, zoom },
  users: { [uid]: { name, cursorX, cursorY, color, online } },

  pendingWrites: { [shapeId]: timestamp },
  currentUser: { uid, displayName, color },
  connectionState: 'connected' | 'disconnected' | 'reconnecting',
  lastSyncTimestamp: number
}
```

**Phase 2‚Äì4 Additions**
```js
{
  createMode: 'rectangle' | 'ellipse' | 'text' | null,
  clipboard: { shapes: [], timestamp: number },
  transforming: { shapeId, mode: 'resize' | 'rotate' | null },
  editingTextId: null,
  
  viewportSaveDebounceTimer: NodeJS.Timeout | null, // For viewport persistence

  aiCommands: { [id]: { status, userId, message, timestamp } },
  chatMessages: [{ role, content, timestamp }],
  aiProcessing: false,

  recentColors: ['#ff0000', '#00ff00'],
  savedColors: ['#000000', '#ffffff'],
  comments: { [id]: { text, author, x, y, replies, resolved } }
}
```

### Shape Architecture

**Unified Bounding Box Model**
All shapes use consistent `x, y, width, height` properties:
- `x, y`: Top-left corner of bounding box (farthest left/up the shape extends)
- `width, height`: Dimensions of axis-aligned bounding box
- `rotation?`: Optional rotation transform applied within the bounding box

**Shape Types:**
- `rectangle`: Renders exactly within bounding box (when rotation=0)
- `ellipse`: Renders as ellipse fit within bounding box (radiusX=width/2, radiusY=height/2)  
- `text`: Renders text within container box (Figma-style text containers)

**Benefits:** Consistent transforms, collision detection, and multi-select operations across all shape types.

### Firestore Collections

```
/canvases/{canvasId}/
  shapes/{shapeId}
    id, type, x, y, width, height, fill, rotation?, fontSize?, text?, zIndex
    updatedAt (ServerTimestamp), updatedBy

  users/{userId}
    uid, displayName, cursorX, cursorY, color, online, lastSeen
    viewport: { x, y, zoom, updatedAt } (per-user viewport persistence)

  comments/{commentId}
    text, author, x, y
    replies: [{ author, text, timestamp }]
    resolved, createdAt, attachedToShape (optional)
```

### Sync Rules

**Write Path**
```
User Action ‚Üí Update Zustand ‚Üí Queue Write ‚Üí Firestore
```

**Read Path**
```
Firestore Listener ‚Üí Timestamp Check ‚Üí Update Zustand
```

**Rules**
- Separate read/write paths  
- Server timestamps authoritative  
- Local pendingWrites prevent echoes  
- Always test in 2+ concurrent browsers  

### AI Execution Flow
```
User Input ‚Üí OpenAI (function calling)
             ‚Üì
   Function Calls Returned
             ‚Üì
   Execute Sequentially ‚Üí Update Zustand ‚Üí Queue Firestore Write
             ‚Üì
   Sync Propagates to All Users
```
All AI edits follow normal sync paths, ensuring deterministic replication.
