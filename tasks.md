# CollabCanvas ‚Äî Task List (PR-by-PR, agent-executable)

**Guidelines / conventions**
- `canvasId = "default-canvas"` unless task says otherwise.
- Use `useCanvasStore()` (Zustand) as the store API unless stated.
- `SyncEngine` is write-only; `useFirestoreSync` is read-only. NEVER mix listeners into write paths.
- All Firestore writes that create/update shapes must set `updatedAt: serverTimestamp()` and `clientTimestamp: Date.now()` fields.
- AI tool actions must go through `ToolRunner.execute(toolName, args)` which then calls `SyncEngine.applyLocalChange()` and `SyncEngine.queueWrite()`.
- Tests must be done locally with **2 browser windows** for collaborative tests.

**üî• LEVERAGE BUILT-IN FEATURES FIRST** (Updated by native feature review)
- **Konva Native Methods**: Use `node.moveToTop()`, `node.moveUp()`, `node.getClientRect()`, `node.absolutePosition()` instead of manual calculations
- **Konva Transformer**: Already properly implemented - continue leveraging all built-in transform features
- **Firebase Real-time**: Already using `onSnapshot()` and `serverTimestamp()` correctly - maintain this pattern
- **Browser APIs**: Consider `navigator.clipboard` for copy/paste (requires HTTPS) with internal fallback
- **Firebase Vertex AI**: Evaluate for AI integration instead of direct OpenAI API calls
- **Selection Rectangle**: Current manual implementation is appropriate (no Konva built-in equivalent)

## Implementation Guidelines

### **Testing Strategy**
- **Unit Tests**: Core logic, store actions, utility functions
- **Integration Tests**: Multi-component workflows, sync scenarios  
- **Manual Testing**: Always use 2+ browser windows for collaborative features
- **Performance Testing**: Monitor FPS and sync latency during development

### **Code Cleanup Strategy**
- **Cleanup Sweep #1** (PR #11): After core canvas features - remove early development artifacts
- **Cleanup Sweep #2** (PR #15): Post-AI integration - clean up AI development artifacts  
- **Cleanup Sweep #3** (PR #16): Post-AI features - prepare for final features and polish
- **Final Cleanup** (PR #18): Pre-deployment - production-ready code audit

### **Cross-PR Acceptance Criteria**
- **Sync Rules**: Maintain separation of read/write paths throughout
- **Two-Browser Testing**: All collaborative features must work across multiple clients
- **Performance Targets**: 60 FPS rendering, <100ms sync latency
- **Code Quality**: Unit tests for complex logic, consistent error handling
- **Documentation**: Update relevant docs with each significant feature addition

### **Conflict Resolution Philosophy**
- **Simple approach**: Timestamp-based "last write wins" for all operations
- **User feedback**: Notify users when simultaneous edits occur
- **No complex rollbacks**: Rely on proven sync architecture for consistency
- **AI operations**: Follow same conflict resolution as human operations
